# Cloth-Simulation
This is a simulation implementing a cloth simulation. The project was first implemented using Matlab and then with compute shaders in OpenGL and GLSL.

> Note that this code requires the navigation and database toolbox for handling of nodes

The core of the cloth model is a system of spring dampers. The model is built upon a structured lattice that consist of particles with a finite mass that are connected to each other by spring-dampers. The spring-damper generates a force on each particle based on its position and velocity.
